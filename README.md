# swift-solo-mission
An updated version of Matt Heaney's Solo Mission iOS game with minor modifications:

 * When hit by an enemy ship, instead of running game over, the player loses a life and a new player ship is respawned; game over once lives reach zero;
 * Code adaptations due to Xcode and SpriteKit updates;
 * Different sound effects and backing music since previous ones have been removed.
